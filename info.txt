TO DO 

ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Production:
Consensus.proto - Use for the consensus
Make sure the database is used correctly 

Multi-node Testing - Start multiple nodes with different ports
Genesis Balance - Configure initial token distribution
Block Rewards - Validators will earn tokens over time
Wallet Integration - External wallets can submit transactions
Remove internal testing - Use an external wallet instead to test transactions
Websockets - should websockets and jsonrpc be used?
TPS & block time to finality - to test
.env.dev & .env.prod - need to be created or not? 
Update account.go to import from config instead
Ask Claude to act as an Audit person to audit the blockchain for vulnabilities 


Key Design Decisions Explained
1. Account-Based State 

Single source of truth - WorldState map
Simple balance tracking - no UTXO complexity
Efficient queries - O(1) account lookups
Easy debugging - clear state representation


Clean interfaces - easy to test and mock
Separation of concerns - each package has single responsibility
Extensible - easy to add smart contracts later
Maintainable - clear code organization

4. Modern Patterns

Context-based - proper Go patterns
Interface-driven - dependency injection ready
Concurrent-safe - proper mutex usage
Event-driven - pubsub for loose coupling
